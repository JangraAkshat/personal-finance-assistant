FinancePal - Personal Finance Assistant
A full-stack web application designed to help users track, manage, and understand their financial activities.

Project Overview üìñ
FinancePal is an intuitive and responsive MERN stack application that serves as a personal finance tracker. It allows users to create secure accounts, log income and expenses, and visualize their spending habits through an interactive dashboard. A key feature is the ability to automatically extract transaction details by uploading a receipt (image or PDF), simplifying the process of data entry. The application is built with a decoupled architecture, featuring a React frontend and a Node.js/Express REST API, with all data persisted in a MongoDB database.

Core Features ‚ú®
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login system using JWT.

Full CRUD Functionality: Users can create, read, update, and delete their income and expense transactions.

Dynamic Dashboard: All transactions are displayed in a paginated list and can be searched by description.

Receipt Scanning (OCR): Upload an image or PDF of a receipt to automatically extract the store name and total amount.

Custom Categories: Users can add and delete their own spending categories for personalized tracking.

Data Visualization: An interactive pie chart provides a clear breakdown of expenses by category, showing both the total amount and percentage.

Bonus Features Implemented ‚≠ê
Pagination: The transaction list API is paginated, sending only 10 items at a time for a fast and efficient user experience.

Multi-User Support: The application supports multiple user accounts, with each user's data kept completely private and secure through JWT-based authorization.
